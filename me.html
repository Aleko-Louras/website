        <p>Hi, I'm Aleko. I’m a passionate developer with a strong focus on web/mobile-app development, working with React/React Native, Android Kotlin JPC, and iOS SwiftUI. I thrive in front-end development, particularly with reactive frameworks, as they enable the creation of simpler, more refined, and easily manageable layouts through state management.
            While back-end development isn’t my primary passion, I deeply enjoy full-stack app development, bringing the components together that make the devices we rely on every day come to life. Additionally, cybersecurity is an area of strong interest. I prioritize secure authentication and database management, ensuring that security remains a key consideration in every project I develop.
        </p>
